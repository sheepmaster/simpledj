SimpleDJ is a DJ application for Mac OS X focused on an easy user interface. It can be left completely unattended for a while, taking over playback and cross-fading, while giving you full control when you want to.

Other features include:

  * Supports multiple audio output devices for cueing
  * Can play every song QuickTime can play
  * Integrates with your iTunes library, giving you access to all your music and playlists
  * Keeps track of all songs played so far, so you can export your DJ set to a playlist
